# Mizaan - Holistic Life Balance Tracker

**A high-performance life-tracking app that merges spiritual discipline, physical health, mental wellbeing, and financial growth into a unified "Master Score".**

---

## 🎯 The Mission

Most habit trackers are fragmented. You need 5 different apps to track Namaz, Gym, and Portfolio. **Mizaan** unifies them to provide a **Holistic Discipline Score** that shows your true life balance.

## ✨ Features

### The Big Five Modules

1. **🌙 Spirit** - Namaz & Quran tracking with progressive streak system
2. **💪 Body** - Gym/Fitness consistency tracking
3. **🧠 Mind** - Screen Time monitoring and digital minimalism
4. **📈 Wealth** - Manual investment ledger (Stocks, MF, Pension, Crypto)
5. **📊 Master Dashboard** - Unified view with radar chart showing balance across all pillars

### Key Highlights

- **Master Streak System** - Tracks your overall consistency across all modules
- **Weekend Wealth Review** - Deliberate UI choice to avoid daily market anxiety
- **Manual Entry Philosophy** - Mindful intentionality over automation
- **Premium UI/UX** - Modern design with gradients, animations, and dark mode
- **Privacy First** - No bank APIs, 100% user-controlled data

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Mindful Wealth Management

Unlike other finance apps, Mizaan uses **manual weekly updates** instead of automated bank connections. This forces users to:

- Actually look at their investment progress
- Make conscious financial decisions
- Avoid daily market anxiety
- Turn finance into a mindful Sunday ritual

### The Master Score Algorithm

The Master Score (0-100%) is calculated based on:

- **Spirit**: Daily Namaz completion + Quran reading
- **Body**: Workout consistency
- **Mind**: Screen time vs. focus time ratio
- **Wealth**: Portfolio growth trend (weekly)

Each pillar contributes equally to create a balanced life score.

## 💡 For Antigravity Community

### Why Manual Over Automated?

In a world of automation, **manual intentionality** is a feature, not a bug. By requiring users to manually update their investments every Sunday, we're not being lazy—we're being deliberate. This creates a weekly ritual that forces reflection and conscious engagement with one's financial health.

### The Tech Behind the Beauty

- **Custom SVG Ring Progress** - Built from scratch using react-native-svg
- **Gradient System** - Expo Linear Gradient for premium aesthetics
- **Type-Safe Navigation** - Full TypeScript support with proper typing
- **Modular Architecture** - Easy to extend with new modules

**Built with ❤️ for a balanced life**
